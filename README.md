Spring Core & Testing
This repository covers key concepts of Spring Core and testing in a Spring-based Java application.

Spring Core
Dependency Injection: Inversion of control (IoC) to manage object creation and dependencies.
Spring Beans: Objects managed by the Spring container. Defined in XML, annotations, or Java config.
Bean Scopes: Control bean lifecycle (singleton, prototype, etc.).
Configuration: Java-based (@Configuration) or XML for Spring setup.
Annotations: Key annotations like @Autowired, @Component, @Service, and @Repository.
AOP: Aspect-Oriented Programming to modularize cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging).
Testing in Spring
Unit Testing: Using JUnit and Mockito to test individual components.
Integration Testing: Use @SpringBootTest to test application context and integration.
Mocking: Mocking dependencies with @MockBean or Mockito for isolated testing.
